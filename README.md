## TODOS

### Must have

- mobile
- Form submission
  - refine styling
  - Submission go back
- **more** (_and more relavant_) **content**
- Newsletter 
- 404
- "via twitter" in ContentCard for influencers
- Meta tags for SEO and social sharing
  - especially cards for twitter!

### Nice to have

- modal with other recommendations
- Room for feedback
- about page
- Tooltips for skill levels
- Tooltips for the format in the content card
- masonry layout for the content
- filter for the topic when clicking on its tag inside a content card
- Accesible sidebars
- Each content having its own page
  - could help with sharing -> MUST VALIDATE -> won't people be more prone to share the actual link?
  - could help with SEO -> I'm not sure this is the case, but it's worth to take a look
  - it'd probably skyrocket build times, wouldn't it?
  - Consider adding `meta og:image` with images dynamically-generated from the content for better sharing -> a service that does this is https://www.url2png.com/
- Schema JSONLD for better SEO and content linkability
- Consider tapping into web mentions?
  - I honestly have no clue if this is valid

### Needs re-structuring

- Consider CSS modules for certain parts of the app
- Reinforce a consistent name for collaborator / contributor / user
- Reinforce a consistent name for collaborator / contributor / user
- Put kommunity in its own repository
